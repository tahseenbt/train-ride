# A Confusing Train Ride

Due to a significant increase in its student population, especially in its Machine Learning department,  the  single  direct  train  going  to  Hogwarts  has  been  replaced  by  a  network  of  15  stations distributed over three lines.  However, this has revealed to not exactly be an improvement.  Just like the staircases within the castle, the stations get bored and, to fight this boredom, rearrange themselves every 2 hours.  However, the stations have not yet started switching lines; they always remain on the same line, but the order of the stations within a line gets shuffled.
